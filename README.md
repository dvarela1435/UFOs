# UFOs


 ## Overview of Project

 The purpose of this project is to have dynamic webpage that provides in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria a the same time. This will allow filter by date, city, state county and the shape of the UFO.

## Results:
This dynamic webpage will be able to filter multiple criteria by filling in the form and press enter when ready.

Once a criteria been entered, the table will automatically filter the results. If none of the items do not meet any of the results, a blank page will be displayed.

## Summary: 
I have noticed a drawbacks with this.
One is the case sensitivity of the fitlers. None of the cities or any of the abbreviations of the states or country are in proper term. If someone was to type the state in the proper form using capitialization, there will not be any results. Same as the proper spelling of the city. 

I would reccomend a dropdown menu for each form filter so that the user would know what option are available instead of guessing. The second recommendation is to find a way to keep the data up to date. This can quickly become out of date within a few weeks. There should be a date withitn the decription so the user can know how current this data is.
